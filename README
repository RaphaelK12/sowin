Note: please also read the README.WIN32 file at the root of the Coin/
sourcecode archive, as most of what is explained there is also valid
for configuring and building the SoWin library.

=========================================================================

SoWin DLL
=========

  If SoWin is compiled as a DLL and you try to link against it, make sure
  you define SOWIN_DLL for your project.  Things might seems to work without
  it for a while, but eventually you will get strange exceptions and heap
  errors.


SoWin C Library Linkage
=======================

  Configure and build the same way as you would on UNIX-based systems,
  i.e.

        $ [srcdir]/configure
        $ make install

  To specify which C library Coin should be linked against, you should
  use the --with-msvcrt=<crt> option.  You have the following choices
  (short aliases on the right):

    singlethread-static        [ /ml  | ml  | libc    ]   (default)
    singlethread-static-debug  [ /mld | mld | libcd   ]
    multithread-static         [ /mt  | mt  | libcmt  ]
    multithread-static-debug   [ /mtd | mtd | libcmtd ]
    multithread-dynamic        [ /md  | md  | msvcrt  ]
    multithread-dynamic-debug  [ /mdd | mdd | msvcrtd ]
