build_sowin_win32.sh

        Builds SoWin for the Win32 platform in different
        configurations. All dependant libraries will be downloaded
        using wget.

        * Requires cygwin and wget. 
        * Run from the command line in any directory.

        This script is used by Systems In Motion when creating binary
        releases of SoWin, and is probably of little use to most
        SoWin users. If you want to configure and build SoWin yourself,
        please read the INSTALL file in the SoWin root directory for 
        instructions.
